## Building and debugging

Currently using openocd to debug. todo finish when the binaries are correctg

### Flashing

The texane stlink couldn't flash the memory of the M4 core, still the `st-info` tool works that can be used to check the state of the board. Besides this, for flashing the ST tool could be used as an alternative. This is capable of connecting after powering down? the device, which is usefult when the onboard stlink can't see the microcontroller. I could successfully erase the flash memory, but after using this setup to flash both cores, the code wouldn't start properly.

## Configurig FreeRTOS

Generating the project using the code provided by the manufacturer is not always sufficient. The two problems that arose were to limited choice of the OS versions and the not proper integration of FreeRTOS [link](https://nadler.com/embedded/newlibAndFreeRTOS.html).

The use of FreeRTOS with newlib or newlib nano requires special care. To make the library work there are a few funcitons that have to be implemented. A few to mention are sbrk that is neccessary for malloc and free, it allocates memory for the allocation, and getpid, exit... Most of the funcitons are basic and are implemented in `syscalls.c`. [link to required funcitons (under doc)](https://sourceware.org/newlib/).

When working in a multitasking environment, reentrancy requires attention. Malloc is an example, where multiple concurrent calls without protection can cause the memory pool to corrupt. Malloc is called in several common library functions.

The default sbrk implementation doesn't take this into account, so no funcions could be safely used requiring malloc. The mentioned source provides a solution where the FreeRTOS tasks are stopped while using malloc. With this solution there is no need for the `heap4.c` files provided by the OS, because the standard funcitons can be utilized (but it might funcion with less guarantees?).

Another problem with the generated ST code is that some HAL functions also use malloc (e.g. the USB driver). When this causes problems, the solution above also solves this problem by disabling interrupts? when mallocing. For this the used stack size is also required (to exclude from possible heap area). This can be guessed, but the solutions also adds a function that returns the used stack size by the USB stack in the interrupt?. (TODO: this part is a bit a foggy for me but probabily not so important, especially without USB)

For the multicore communication a newer version would be nice. To ease the use of Message Buffers, not only the ovewriting of the SEND_COMPLETED? macro is the only solution anymore, for each message buffer seperate callback functions can be added.
