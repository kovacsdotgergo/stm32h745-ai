# Infos about the state of the project

## Power supply

CubeMX didn't have the previously used DIRECT_SMPS option when selecting power supply, LDO was used. When using this the application couldn't run. I copied over the previously used power supply configuration to the source code.

## Generated makefile

When generating the project, I edited the generated makefile, and it seems like modifications and regeneration didn't replace these changes, so the makefile might not be the same that would be generated by default.

## Syscalls.h and sysmem.h

When generating the MX project with FreeRTOS, these two files were added in the makefile as sources of the project, without adding the actual files. Of course the project didn't build without them. They contain posix system calls, some from the `man syscalls` page. These functions can also be found in `unistd.h` (this file can be found in the arm-none-eabi include folder).

After searching for places where any of the functions can be called in the project or where the files would be included, I deleted these files (I didn't find any call or include).
