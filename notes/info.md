# Infos about the state of the project

## Power supply

CubeMX didn't have the previously used DIRECT_SMPS option when selecting power supply, LDO was used. When using this the application couldn't run. I copied over the previously used power supply configuration to the source code.

## Generated makefile

When generating the project, I edited the generated makefile, and it seems like modifications and regeneration didn't replace these changes, so the makefile might not be the same that would be generated by default.
