# Short and long range plans

* merging the hex of bin or elf files
* loading the application for release mode
* loadign the application for debug mode
* use of the cross trigger interface
* openocd or stlink

## Next steps

* make a starter project with freertos
* compare to prev project
* finalize setup after running correctly

* research about isa, nn acceleratos...
* try compilers

## Ai compilers

* cube ai
* tflite
* nvidia

## Building and utilities

* docker
    * dependencies: arm bin, stlink, openocd, ?srec_cat
* clang-format
* read about starting udev in wsl to remove the one minute wait time
    * for this read about login and interactive shells, maybe only running the start comamnd in a login shell would solve the probelm -> in which startup file run the start command
* build task `build current` based on the inellisense configuration instead of build cm4 and cm7
* restructure and remove the makefile folder
* cross trigger interface?
